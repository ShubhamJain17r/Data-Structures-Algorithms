/* 
Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

Important : 
    Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:
    0 <= j <= nums[i] and
    i + j < n
    Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1
